                Yes, Tanah Lot is believed to have sacred sea snakes that guard the temple from evil
                spirits and intruders. These snakes are black and white banded sea kraits ( Laticauda
                colubrina ), and they are said to be the protectors of the temple.

                Local legend tells the story of a Hindu priest, Dang Hyang Nirartha, who established the
                Tanah Lot temple in the 16th century. When he meditated on the rock, he was disturbed by
                the local fishermen. He then used his power to transform his scarf into a sea snake with
                poisonous venom to protect the temple.

                While these snakes are venomous, they are generally not aggressive towards humans unless
                they feel threatened. The priests at Tanah Lot often handle them, and they are
                considered sacred by the local people. Visitors may sometimes see these snakes around
                the base of the rock island.

                Yes, foreigners are allowed to enter the Tanah Lot Temple complex.
                However, there's a distinction to be made:
                Foreigners can freely explore the outer areas of the temple complex. This includes the
                pathways, surrounding viewpoints, shops, and restaurants. You can get quite close to the
                iconic rock formation and enjoy the views, especially during sunset.
